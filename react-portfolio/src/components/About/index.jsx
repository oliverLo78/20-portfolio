        Ready to embark on the journey of Software Engineer. I enjoy creating Websites and software applications to improve the end user experience. Very excited to be a part of UCF coding bootcamp. I'm a catalyst with plenty of energy inlearning HTML & CSS and Git, JavaScript & Web APIs, Node.js
        With each project, I aim to understand how best to engage users for an impactful user experience while keeping stakeholder initiatives in mind. I practice fiscal responsibility to optimize business solutions and product outcomes.
        When Iâ€™m not coordinating projects and promoting efficiency, I enjoy visiting beautiful islands like Punta Cana and Bora Bora, trying out new recipes, or honing my skills with new courses.
