Your task is to create a portfolio using your new React skills, which will help set you apart from other developers whose portfolios don’t use the latest technologies.

## Description

You’ll deploy this application to GitHub Pages. Follow the instructions in the Git Guide or consult the Create React App Docs on GitHub Pages to create a build that you can deploy.

Important: Be sure to push your codebase to the default branch in GitHub -- NOT your built and deployed code. Ensure this happens by using the gh-pages branch to host the deployed application's build.

## User Story

AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a single-page application portfolio for a web developer
WHEN I load the portfolio
THEN I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer
WHEN I view the header
THEN I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio
WHEN I view the navigation titles
THEN I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted
WHEN I click on a navigation title
THEN I am presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted
WHEN I load the portfolio the first time
THEN the About Me title and section are selected by default
WHEN I am presented with the About Me section
THEN I see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them
WHEN I am presented with the Portfolio section
THEN I see titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repositories
WHEN I am presented with the Contact section
THEN I see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message
WHEN I move my cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text
THEN I receive a notification that this field is required
WHEN I enter text into the email address field
THEN I receive a notification if I have entered an invalid email address
WHEN I am presented with the Resume section
THEN I see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies
WHEN I view the footer
THEN I am presented with text or icon links to the developer’s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile on a third platform (Stack Overflow, Twitter)

### Website

As a user you may add notes to the application. It will save your notes to a database so you may leave the page and have the notes stay. 

Should you wish to have access to the text editor on your local device merely hitthe `Install` button at the top left of the screen. All of your notes will carry over.

### Developer

From your terminal, run `npm run start:dev` in order to generate a `dist` folder. You will see that within the dist we have a condensed Progressive Web Application.

In order to see the application at work navigate to [localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) .
