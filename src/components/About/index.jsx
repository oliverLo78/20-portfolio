          Hi my name is Oliver  Ready to embark on the journey of Software Engineer. I enjoy creating Websites and software applications to improve the end user experience. Very excited to be a part of UCF coding bootcamp. A catalyst with plenty of energy in learning HTML & CSS and Git, JavaScript & Web APIs, Node.js.<br></br><br></br>
          When Iâ€™m not coordinating projects and promoting efficiency, I enjoy visiting beautiful islands like Punta Cana, Bora Bora, trying out new recipes, and working at honing my skills with new coding courses.<br></br><br></br>
          I am very excited of being involved in the tech industry as a Web Developer and would jump at the opportunity to be a part of a company that shares similar values.</p><br></br>
